# Memento

UofTHacks 11's theme of Nostalgia reminded us of our childhoods and how we read stories, being so immersed in them. As a result, we created an application that brings that nostalgia to life.
Meet Memento, a web application that asks users to input an image, date, and brief description of the memory associated with the provided image. Doing so, users are then given a generated story full of tone, emotions, and thrill allowing them to relive the past in a unique and comforting way.
